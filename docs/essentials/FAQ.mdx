## Agent issues

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="AI4DAgent said it made a file / database / script, where can I find it?">
  At present, AI4DAgent does not have the capability to generate outputs in this
  way. However, this is a feature we're actively developing. To keep updated on
  this, check out our [roadmap](/roadmap).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Did AI4DAgent really email 100 people?">
  Not yet! We're looking into implementing this functionality. To see when this
  might be available, take a look at our [roadmap](/roadmap). We guarantee that
  actions such as "sending an email" will only occur with your explicit
  permission.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My agent keeps running out of loops!">
  Due to limitations on API usage and infrastructure costs, there's a cap on how
  much the Agent can run. To circumvent this, consider hosting AI4DAgent locally
  using your own API key. Alternatively, subscribing to our pro plan will allow
  for increased limits. More details can be found in our [setup
  documentation](/roadmap).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My Agent was running smoothly, but then it stopped! Can I resume from where it left off?">
  Currently, each Agent run is independent, so resuming isn't possible. However,
  you can initiate another AI4DAgent run using information from the previous run.
  We plan on adding this feature in the future. Stay updated via our
  [roadmap](/roadmap).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can AI4DAgent use GPT-4?">
  Currently, free-tier users of AI4DAgent utilize GPT-3.5, while PRO users have
  access to GPT-4. If you have API access to GPT-4, you can run AI4DAgent locally
  using your API key.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why does the output keep getting cut off?">
  The output length is limited to manage generation costs on our end. If you're
  using your own API key, you can adjust the output length within the advanced
  settings by increasing the token count. If you're a Pro user or are a running
  AI4DAgent locally, you can adjust the output length winthin the advanced
  settings
